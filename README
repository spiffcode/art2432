This is 24 bit art straight from Mark Soderwall (artist), at tile size "32".
It has not been incoporated into the game. There are several issues:

1. It hasn't been incorported, or tested in any form, in the game.

2. It hasn't been looked on on a real device, where color reproduction
   differs from a computer screen.

3. The game has an 8 bit graphics path. It doesn't yet support 16
   or 24 bit graphics.

4. This size is suitable for iPhone / iPod display sizes. Yet to be tested
   on iPad.

5. There is still work to get this art into shape:
    * There will be mistakes in animation frames
    * The .amx files are not ready
    * The fonts need to be constructed from the letters
    * The terrain art, although present, hasn't been tested in a real sense

6. Note the side colors are not done the same way as the 8 bit art. In this
   art, the "black" animation frames get subtracted from the non-black
   variants to isolate side colors. Then the side colors are hue-mapped
   to the desired hue, then added back into the "black" variant to get
   a composed animation frame. TBD if this is a run time or compile time
   process.
